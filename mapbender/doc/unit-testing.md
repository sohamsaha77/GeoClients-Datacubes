# Prerequisites

## Development dependencies installed
You need to install composer development dependencies. This will not change the versions
of already installed packages, only add extra packages required to run tests.
 
You need to run
```sh
bin/composer install --dev
```
from your `application` directory.

You can revert back to a shipping state by running
```sh
bin/composer install --no-dev
```

### Posix + bash + PHP>=5.6
It might work on gitbash and / or cygwin with some fiddling.


# Running choices
Run all tests, including "functional" browser-simulating tests, by invoking
```
bin/run_tests.sh
```

(that's the top-level bin, _not_ the application/bin)

This will require phantomjs on your path. If it can't invoke phantomjs it will bail and do nothing.


Run just the straightforward set of in-process tests by invoking
```
bin/run_tests-dev.sh
```
This one does not require phantomjs.

Both of these commands can be invoked from any current working directory you want.

You can create a symlink to a project's bin/run_tests-dev.sh somewhere in your path and get
immediate access from anywhere.

Additional command line arguments are passed through to phpunit. Try
```
bin/run_tests-dev.sh --help
```

# Authoring tests
By default, application/src (suite "Project") and the mapbender/fom/owsproxy trinity of directories
are scanned for *Test classes. They can be located anywhere, inside or outside of bundles, phpunit
will find them.

Please [annotate your tests with `@group`](https://phpunit.de/manual/5.7/en/appendixes.annotations.html#appendixes.annotations.group)
to appropriately preclassify them as either `unit` or `functional`. Additional groups may be
stacked on top (a test case can be placed into more than one group).

If one group makes sense for all tests in your test case, you can annotate the class once, and
all tests within it will inherit the setting.
